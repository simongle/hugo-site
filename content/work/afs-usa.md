As part of a freelance contract, I worked with the communications team in migrating storytelling content about the experiences of students traveling abroad and their host families from a older system to a Rails-based Content Management System.

With roughly 800 pieces of HTML content to migrate I saw an opportunity for automation. Using [this bash script](https://gist.github.com/simongle/adffe56c27c0c0c543e1133b77e1a049) which utilizes `jq` and `cURL` I was able to import batches of chapters into the new CMS in a fraction of the timethat a manual process would have necessitated.
