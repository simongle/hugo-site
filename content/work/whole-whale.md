As the resident developer and one of the original team-members at  Whole Whale, a small digital agency focused on serving nonprofits and mission-driven companies, I built and maintained websites for our clients, as well as the agency's own Wordpress site. Some of our clients included Power Poetry, Planned Parenthood, National Aphasia Association, Salvation Army and NYC Department for the Aging. 

Much of the work also included strategizing and implementing SEO solutions and content optimization. Much of these efforts were driven by collecting data from Google Analytics, AdWords and A/B testing with Optimizely.
