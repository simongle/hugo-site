As a contributor to the Site Engineering and Elections Engineering teams, I helped overhaul our publishing pipeline at every level of the stack, from content creation in our CMS to CDN delivery to browser performance optimization. I worked heavily with react and node based applications  deployed with AWS infrastructure. I was also a member of an on-call rotation managing and debugging high-throughput systems serving publishing pipelines. I have been fortunate to manage more junior teammates and was the lead engineer on multiple projects.

### Highlights:
- Led a project building a static version of the Post's homepage to be served statically in the case of a disaster scenario from s3. The page was built using NextJS and Node. 
- As part of an election support team, worked as a key engineer on the 2017-2019 election nights; periods of extremely high traffic and national attention for the website. 
- Worked as part of the team overhauling the Post's live election night coverage. 
- Completed coursework for the AWS Technical Solutions Architect Certification.
