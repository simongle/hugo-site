I worked with public policy teams to develop interactive application features using various Javascript libraries, mostly hosted on our Wordpress site, others ran in external publications. 

I built and maintained a customized modular Wordpress platform, continuously developing new features and a/b testing front-end features to increase time on site. I worked with the privacy and surveillance team to administer a SecureDrop server and set up secure networking channels to support the work of our fellows communicating with rigorous privacy needs. 

My engineering work was heavily heavily based in PHP and Javascript.
